## Input Command (Output of input function is always string)
# name = input('What is your name? ') # input command prints the prompt and waits for user input value. We assign the user input string to variable name
# print('Hello, ' + name) # Addition and other operations only work with variables with the same data type

## Simple Toy Code
name = input('What is your name? ')
fav_color = input('What is your favorite color? ')
print(name + ' likes ' + fav_color + '.')
